Congratulations!

You’ve created a `Whatsapp` app!

Thanks a lot to [Idan Wender](https://github.com/idanwe/), [Dotan Simha](https://github.com/dotansimha) and [Eytan Manor](https://github.com/Urigo) who helped me ([Urigo](https://github.com/urigo)) a lot with this post.

Please also check out the `Meteor` version of the same blog which also includes adding a profile picture and send a picture in the chat.

Compare the two solutions yourself and choose what’s best for you.

You are welcome to add more features and extend this tutorial by pull requesting [this repository](https://github.com/Urigo/Ionic-MeteorCLI-WhatsApp).

Creating a full stack real time mobile app has never been so fast and easy.

And the most important thing - the tools we used (`Meteor`, `Ionic`) are good not only for simple use cases but also for a full production scale apps.

You can safely start with those solutions knowing that you won't have to switch to different solutions when your app will scale and add features.
